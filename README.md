## 📌 Project Description
This project is a simple, client-side prototype of a **Task Manager with Team Collaboration**, implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It simulates a system where users can manage tasks, comment on them, attach files, and track progress — all designed for easy collaboration in a team setting.

This repository contains the **Iteration 3 deliverables**, including new use cases and functional prototypes.

## ✅ Features Implemented in Iteration 3

### 1. **Comment on Task**  
Users can add time-stamped comments to specific tasks. Comments are appended below the task for group visibility.

### 2. **Upload File to Task**  
Users can attach files to tasks (simulated). The uploaded filename and time are displayed under the task.

### 3. **Mark Task as Complete**  
Users can change a task’s status to “Completed” with a button, and the interface reflects this change in real-time.

---

## 🧠 Use Cases

Each implemented feature corresponds to a formal use case:

- **Comment on Task:** Post and view a thread of messages tied to a task.
- **Upload File to Task:** Attach supporting files to tasks.
- **Mark Task as Complete:** Toggle task status and reflect on the dashboard.

Full descriptions are documented in our Iteration 3 Submission file.

## 💡 User Stories

- A team member types a comment in a text box and sees it appear in a live thread.
- A manager uploads a wireframe PDF to a design task and sees it listed.
- A developer finishes work and marks their task complete, with an instant UI update.
